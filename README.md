Three regions in M31, in CO and HCN

8 CO obsnums in 3 regions, and 11 HCN  obsnums in one region.

The CO shows clearly emission is all the way to the edge of the field,
which will make it more challenging ,  since the sensitivity towards
the edge goes down, and some of the effects of the OTF turn-around may
be visible

All of the data suffer from the pre Feb-2020 doppler bug, which caused
some some fraction of data with high RMS to be (automatically) removed
from the scans.
